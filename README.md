# objective-c-playground [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/objective-c-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/objective-c-playground)

Playground environment for learning Objective C and iOS

We've been using the following guides:

- [Start Developing iOS Apps Today by Apple (Objective-C version)](https://github.com/mrshyi/RoadMapiOS/blob/d78ec91c80903991c70124d37db54adf42a0c0c9/RoadMapiOS.pdf)

## Getting Started
To get this repo running locally, perform the following:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:twolfson/objective-c-playground.git
cd objective-c-playground

# Install our dependencies
# Nothing here yet...

# Open our project in Xcode
open objective-c-playground.xcodeproj

# Press the "Play" button
```

Upon pressing the "Play" button, there should be no compilation errors and the application will launch in a simulator

## Questions/Answers
These are questions I've asked myself while learning

- Is there a slick way to bump versions via a script?
- What do tests look like?
- What does CI look like? What environments support it (e.g. TravisCI, CircleCI)
- What does package management look like? I think there's CocoaPods but can we verify that's the canonical tool?
    - Also, relevant from `.gitignore` template -- https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
- Explore Carthage, fastlane, and code injection mentioned in https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/fad779220742a6d54ccfc0c1a0e5b3d820253de6/Objective-C.gitignore#L39-L63

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

_(Testing coming soon)_
