## Questions/Answers
These are questions I've asked myself while learning

- Is there a slick way to bump versions via a script?
- What do tests look like?
- What does package management look like? I think there's CocoaPods but can we verify that's the canonical tool?
    - Also, relevant from `.gitignore` template -- https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
- Explore Carthage, fastlane, and code injection mentioned in https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/fad779220742a6d54ccfc0c1a0e5b3d820253de6/Objective-C.gitignore#L39-L63

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

_(Testing coming soon)_
